This library aims to implement the main communication layer between the
Application VMs and the Appliance VMs.

# Requirements

To build Vinetalk you will require cmake, ccmake and (optionaly but recomened) libpoco:

## ArchLinux

``sudo pacman -S cmake poco``

## CentOS

``sudo yum install cmake poco-foundation poco-net``

## Ubuntu

``sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui libpoco-dev``

# Folder layout

# Building

Vinetalk is built as a shared library(libvine.so), using cmake and make:

First build and navigate to your build folder:

<code>mkdir build;cd build</code>

You must then configure your build using ccmake or cmake directly:

## Configure with CCMake

Run <code>ccmake ..</code> in your build folder and press `c` once:

![ccmake screenshot](docs/ccmake_scr.png)

Every line correspond to a build option(see below for option descriptions).
To change/set an option press enter, this will toggle a Boolean flag or allow you to edit a string option.
For string press enter again to end string input.

Once you have configured your build, press `c` followed by `g`.

## Configure with CMake

To configure using, on the build folder you type:

<code>cmake [Configuration Options] ..</code>

## CCMake

Run <code>ccmake ..</code> in your build forder and press c:

## Build with Make

After configuring, run <code>make</code>

## Testing

After building with tests enabled, you can run tests with <code>make test</code>.

## Install

VineTalk can be 'installed' in two ways.
System Wide install is the recomened method if deploying on a dedicated machine and have root/sudo access.
User Specific installation is recomended if deploying in a shared machine with multiple users and dont have root/sudo access.

### System Wide Install

After a successful build, run <code>make install</code>, with root privileges.

### User Specific Install

You can use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH eviroment variable to load VineTalk from the build path.

<code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<VineTalk build path></code>

To find the apropriate VineTalk build path, run:

<code>make VineTalkBuildPath</code>

## Using the Vine Talk Library

After a successful build your build directory will have a libvine.so file as well as
an include folder. Add your build path as a library path and link with vinetalk <code>-lvine</code>.
Also add the build/includes folder to your gcc include paths <code>-Ibuild/includes</code>.

# Configuration

In order to configure the vine_pipe endpoints, the user must provide
architecture specific options.

These configuration options are stored at ~/.vinetalk and follow the format
specified in utils/config.h.

The sections bellow specify the required keys for each supported vinetalk
architecture:

## Breakdowns

The BREAKS_ENABLE allow the generation of breakdowns(.brk) and headers (.hdr) for performance evaluation
of the VineTalk system.

Steps:
- Enable BREAKS_ENABLE option and rebuild VineTalk.
- Run applications...
- When the controller terminates, you will have .hdr and .brk files for all procedures that run.

## Vdf

Vdf is a program located at the examples folder, allowing run time inspection of allocator statistics and breakdowns(and more to come).
To be built it requires the Poco framework to be installed.

After running it spawns a web server at localhost:8888.
The web ui allows inspection of allocator statistics and breakdowns.

## shm

Shm implements the vinetalk API/protocol over a shared segment
(POSIX or ivshmem).

### Required Configuration Keys

| Option   | Description                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| shm_file | A file path specifying the shared segments file. |
| shm_size | The size of the shared segment in bytes.         |

### Optional Configuration Keys

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| shm_trunc   | A boolean (0,1) setting if the shm_file should be truncated during initialization.                                      |
| shm_off     | Start mmap from the given byte offset instead from 0.Can be used to split a single shm to multiple vine_pipe instances. |
| shm_ivshmem | Boolean , set to 1 if running inside a Vm with ivshmem.                                                                 |
